As the Creator of this NFT and the associated work, I make the following warrants and grants and assume the associated obligations toward whomever the current owner of the packaged NFT might be, provided that they uphold the Owner Obligations and Royalties to the reasonable extent of their ability:

I warrant that this NFT is and shall remain a unique collectible asset to the reasonable extent of my ability to ensure this outcome, and I hereby forfeit my right to create another NFT or functionally identical cryptographic instrument of this specific work without the written consent of the present owner as my means of ensuring performance of this clause.

I retain all rights and usage of the original work represented by this NFT.

In addition to the rights already afforded to third parties under any form of public licensing which the work has been published under, I hereby grant a limited, worldwide, irrevocable, and non-transferable license to the present owner of this NFT for the duration of their ownership of the NFT to both privately use or print and publicly display the associated work in any single digital location which is capable of cryptographic verification of the NFT's authenticity and which continues to regularly validate such verification for the duration of the display.
